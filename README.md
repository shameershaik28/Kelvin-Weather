Kelvin Weather
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction. Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However, there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

With our knowledge of JavaScript, we can help Kelvin by converting temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius and then to Fahrenheit.

Project Description
This project provides a simple JavaScript application that converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit. The application takes an input temperature in Kelvin and outputs the equivalent temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Example Conversion:
For example, a temperature of 283 K converts to:

10 °C (Celsius)
50 °F (Fahrenheit)

Features:
Converts temperature from Kelvin to Celsius
Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
Provides a clear and easy-to-understand output
